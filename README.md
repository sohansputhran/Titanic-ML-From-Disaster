# Titanic: Machine Learning From Disaster
Predicting survival on the Titanic with the datasets given in the Kaggle's ML competition 

Used the given dataset to train the model using different algorithms such as:
Logistic Regression,
Nearest Neighbor (kNN),
Support Vector Machine (SVM),
Kernel SVM,
Na√Øve Bayes,
Decision Tree and
Random Forest Classification

Visualized the data in different ways to understand it clearly.
